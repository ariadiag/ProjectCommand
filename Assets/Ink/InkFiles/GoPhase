// This info can be gathered in two different ways. One through calling the person back who is at the Escape Shuttle or by looking it up on your computer.	
    // Looking it up: To look it up, go into Emergency Escape Operations, then find Albatross, then look for the Escape Shuttle Information. There will be a collection of info about the Escape Shuttle’s specs. On that list will be the Escape Shuttle Shielding Transponder ID: (53m-cba)
    // Calling person you sent to Escape Shuttle:
        // Could you give me the Escape Shuttle Shielding Transponder ID?
        // I need the Escape Shuttle Shielding Transponder ID.
        // Can you give me the Escape Shuttle Shielding Transponder ID?
        // ...
            - Of course. Let me open up the spec panel…….one second…………………...here it is, its 53m-cba. #Aaron
            - Roger. I’m opening the spec panel now…….it’s 53m-cba. #Harper
            - Oh! S-sure, let me get the spec panel up……………..so...its 53m-cba! #Sunny

// When you have the right info you have to call the person back.
// If Wrong Answer: Getting the answer wrong here will lock the shielding system, requiring the player to try and win the decrypting mini-game. Losing three times will cause the shielding to malfunction, making it inoperable (they won't be able to use it).
- Hmm….nothing happened…………………………...wait……………...something’s erroring out! The wrong code must’ve glitched the failing s-system! #Aaron
- Let’s see…..nothing so far………….nop-wait………...the shields are falling…...the wrong code must’ve glitched the failing system. #Harper
- O-okay! Let me try……...okay…………...w-wait……….the shields are dropping! The wrong c-code must’ve glitched the fragile s-system! #Sunny

//Now it’s either a normal or raced finish. If the player got the last question wrong, the timer which has been counting down since the beginning will immediately flip to one minute regardless or its past time. The ship will begin its final arc of falling apart.
