#--Software Needed--#

3. Initialize Git LFS!!!!
4. Open a scene from the Assets Folder (in the Repo)
5. *Import 'Ink/Unity Integration' from the Asset Store
6. Voila! We're done.

(5.5. Optionally, you can install 'Github for Unity' from the Asset Store. This will make it so you can push changes from within Unity.)

*On any new machine, you will have to re-import anything gotten off of the asset store. This was the *simplest* way to get this working.
